CHANGES SINCE 0.2-9

New features

* All plot functions now produce objects of class "ggplot".
* layOut: Lays out graphs of class ggplot.
* mannKen: Added mts and plot options.

* mts2ts: Prepare spatial time series for further analysis.
* plotSeason: Added another way of plotting.
* seaRoll: Plotting is an additional option.
* trendHomog: Test for homogeneity of seasonal trends.
* tsSub: Utility function to drop seasons in a ts.

Terminology changes

* plotEof: Changed to eofPlot.

CHANGES SINCE 0.2-8

New features

* phenoPhase: Integration defaults can now be changed, if necessary.
* plotSeason: Added smoother when type='by.month'.
* seasonTrend: Changed appearance and some options.

Bugs fixed

* plotSeason: Fixed problem when type='by.month'.
* plotTsTile: Now plots correct colours when four=FALSE.
* tsMake: Fixed problem when layer of class "numeric".

CHANGES SINCE 0.2-5

Terminology changes

* wqData: Changed "narrow" to "long".
* plotSeas: Changed to plotSeason.

New features

* ammFrac: New function for un-ionized ammonium.
* plotSeason: Added option to plot individual months for entire record.
* seasonTrend: New function for time series trends by season.
* tsMake: Now allows for more ways of specifying depths.

Bugs fixed

* mannKen, seaKen: Now gives correct sign when trend given as %.
* phenoAmp: Fixed problem when subsetting months leaves no data for year.
* phenoPhase: Fixed problem when subsetting months and x is a "zoo" object.
* plotSeason: Now handles num = 1.
* tsMake: Fixed problem when focus consisted of a single variable or site.

CHANGES SINCE 0.2-2

New features

* interpTs: Option to fill with long-term mean or median.
* plotSeas: Option to choose number of intervals.
* WqData plot method: Option to choose variables.

Bugs fixed

* phenoPhase: Fixed problem where max.time month number given relative to subset rather than whole year
* plotTsTile: More useful error message when not enough data.
* seaRoll: Fixed problem with frequencies other than 12.
* tsMake: Remove need to specify layer if no depth info.
* WqData subset method: Removed because of strategy that WqData objects	should not be changed.
* wqData: Argument value "narrow" changed to more conventional "long".
* wqData: Now requires time.format to be specified.
* wqData: Now ensures variable is a factor when type = "long".
